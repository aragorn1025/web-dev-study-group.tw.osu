- Strong Typing vs Weak Typing
  - Strong Typing: C, C++, Java
  - Weak Typing: JavaScript, Python
    - TypeScript is not a perfectly strongly typed language. It is relatively more strongly typed than JavaScript, yet it retains some flexibility inherited from JavaScript.
- JavaScript
  - [`getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
  - `var` vs `let` vs `const`
    - `var`
      - Function-scoped, not block-scoped.
      - Misuse can easily cause bugs.
      - **In modern best practice, it is recommended to avoid using it.**
    - `let`
      - Block-scoped.
      - Can be reassigned, cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
      - Use for variables that will change, e.g., loop counters.
    - `const`
      - Block-scoped.
      - Cannot be reassigned.
      - Objects/arrays assigned to it can still be mutated.
      - Recommended to use it by default for variables that do not need reassignment.
  - Named Function
    ```javascript
    function greet(name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
    greet("Aragorn");
    ```
    - There must be a **function name**.
    - Parameters are optional.
    - The function body is required, but a return value is optional.
  - Arrow Function / Lambda Expression
    ```javascript
    console.log(
        ((name) => {
            return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        })("Aragorn")
    );
    ```
    - The function itself has no name and can be called directly.
      - This is called an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
    ```javascript
    const greet = (name) => {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    };
    greet("Aragorn");
    ```
    - Usually assigned to a variable or used as a callback.
    ```javascript
    const greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name + "!";
    greet("Aragorn");
    ```
    - A lambda expression can be written in a simplfied form if it directly returns a value.
  - Event Listener
    ```javascript
    const button = document.getElementById("my-button");
    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button is clicked.");
    });
    ```
    - Use `getElementById` to get the target element and assign it to a `const`.
    - Use an arrow function (lambda expression) for the callback function, the common parameter for this would be `event`, add it if needed.
    - Use `addEventListener` to assign the actions to the element.
    - Supports many types of events, e.g., "click", "mouseover", "keydown", "input", "submit", etc.
